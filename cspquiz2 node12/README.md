# Trivia3

Node.js/Socket.io triva game with q/a stored in json



This trivia game was based on @Glitch's Website Starter Kit. [glitch.com/edit/#!/intro-to-node](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/intro-to-node) My goal was to handle question/answer storage server-side, store game progress, and make it multiplayer.

The game has gone through three iterations.
* v1: [triviagame.glitch.me](https://triviagame.glitch.me/) 
* v2: [trivia2.glitch.me](https://trivia2.glitch.me/)
* v3: [trivia3.glitch.me](https://trivia3.glitch.me/)

This project is also based on @_gw & @jennschiffer's [socketio-chat](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/socketio-chat) project which taught me how to use @SocketIO
