# p5share

Node.js collaborative art web app using p5js with AJAX polling

[p5share.glitch.me](p5share.glitch.me) is a shared @p5xjs canvas based on [this starter p5js sketch](https://p5js.org/get-started/) In this I used AJAX polling rather than Socket.IO but I'll probably switch it someday. Still a few bugs but fun. #interactiveArt

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing.

Based on the p5js [getting started tutorial example](https://p5js.org/get-started/) project, that captures mouse movement and prints circles as you move it around.
